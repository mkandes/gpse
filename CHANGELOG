CHANGELOG : GPSE

dev

    * testing simple parallel I/O implementation; developing alternative
      MPI-I/O parallel I/O (psiOutput) option, where the wave function 
      output file remains intact as one file, but is written to 
      simultanesouly from all MPI processes using the MPI-I/O protocol

2016/10/17 v0.5.4

    + implemented first version of a simple parallel I/O (psiOutput)
      option, where a complete wave function is simultaneously written 
      out to many small, individual files only containing the portion of
      the wave function overseen by an MPI process

2016/01/19 v0.5.3

    + GPSE from M. C. Kandes, "Modeling the Effects of Inertial Forces 
      on Bose-Einstein Condensates in Rotating Frames of Reference", 
      Ph.D. dissertation, Claremont Graduate University and San Diego 
      State University (2015).
