CHANGELOG : GPSE

dev

    * support for probability mass-current analysis
    * support for large file sizes (> 2GB) with MPI-I/O 

2019/05/19 v0.6.0

    + implemented VTK reader function (io_read_vtk) to allow simple 
      parallel I/O read of input wave function
    + added logical flag (chkptOn) to control whether or not checkpoint
      wave function is written out at the end of each simulation.
    + started reformatting source code to be more compactly written; 
      intended to follow 72 character wide, pep8-like format

2017/08/16 v0.5.9

    + initial wave fuctions computed with psi_init when psiInput == 0 
      are now also normalized numerically; this provides proper 
      normalization to initial wave functions where analytic 
      normalizations constants are not known; e.g. see psiInt == 3 for
      the approximate ground state wave function of a 3D simple harmonic 
      oscillator ring potential
    - commented out MPI-I/O-based wave function checkpoint that occurs 
      at the end of a completed simulation; MPI-I/O files are currently
      limited to a maximum size of approximately 2GB for some unknow 
      reason; further investigation required
    + reverted to serialized binary checkpoint from v0.5.6

2017/01/22 v0.5.8

    + set checkpoint wave function file to 'psi-501.bin'

2017/01/22 v0.5.7

    + replaced serial version of new wave function checkpoint with one
      that uses MPI-I/O

2017/01/22 v0.5.6

    + implemented checkpoint; last wave function is now written out to a
     binary file in order to provide a checkpoint from where a new
     simulation may be started to continue where the last one left off

2017/01/03 v0.5.5

    + implemented MPI-I/O (psiOutput) option with explicit-offsets to
      write each wave function out to a single binary file

2016/10/17 v0.5.4

    + implemented first version of a simple parallel I/O (psiOutput)
      option, where a complete wave function is simultaneously written 
      out to many small, individual files only containing the portion of
      the wave function overseen by an MPI process

2016/01/19 v0.5.3

    + GPSE from M. C. Kandes, "Modeling the Effects of Inertial Forces 
      on Bose-Einstein Condensates in Rotating Frames of Reference", 
      Ph.D. dissertation, Claremont Graduate University and San Diego 
      State University (2015).
