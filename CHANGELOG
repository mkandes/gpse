    * MPI-I/O (psiInput) option to read in initial wave function from
      single binary file in parallel

2017/01/22 v0.5.7

    + replaced serial version of new wave function checkpoint with one
      that uses MPI-I/O

2017/01/22 v0.5.6

    + implemented checkpoint; last wave function is now written out to a
     binary file in order to provide a checkpoint from where a new
     simulation may be started to continue where the last one left off

2017/01/03 v0.5.5

    + implemented MPI-I/O (psiOutput) option with explicit-offsets to
      write each wave function out to a single binary file

2016/10/17 v0.5.4

    + implemented first version of a simple parallel I/O (psiOutput)
      option, where a complete wave function is simultaneously written 
      out to many small, individual files only containing the portion of
      the wave function overseen by an MPI process

2016/01/19 v0.5.3

    + GPSE from M. C. Kandes, "Modeling the Effects of Inertial Forces 
      on Bose-Einstein Condensates in Rotating Frames of Reference", 
      Ph.D. dissertation, Claremont Graduate University and San Diego 
      State University (2015).
